    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.

      const article = `Advocates say the stress and instability caused by the evictions was unnecessary.

“These outcomes were entirely foreseeable,” said Louisa Bassini, a managing lawyer at Inner Melbourne Community Legal.

“These clients necessarily have a history of homelessness, so the threat of a return to that way of existing which they have a recent memory of is hugely unsettling for people. It means that all other aspects of their lives are put on hold until they can secure suitable housing.

“Using the threat of eviction against people with a history of homelessness ought to have been avoided.”

The Coalition housing spokesman, Richard Riordan, described the issuing of eviction notices as “callous”.

“This is a whole other level of incompetence really. You’ve invited and accepted 1,800 people into a program, with a clear undertaking that you’re going to give them some long-term stability in life, and now you’re evicting them?” he said.

“Any good work that was done over the last two years will unravel.”

The Greens spokeswoman, Samantha Ratnam, said axing the H2H program would “almost certainly” result in people back out on the street.`;
